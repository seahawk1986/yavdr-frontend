# wait-for-vdr-snd-release

This program searches for a process in /proc/ whose cmdline program name
(last part after the rightmost slash) is "vdr".
If no process is found, it returns immediately. Otherwise it uses readlink to search
for open file descriptors containing "/dev/snd".
If at least one open file descriptor for a sound device is found,
it waits up to 5 seconds for the vdr to release all sound devices, rechecking during this period.

`wait-for-vdr-snd-release` requires permissions to access
`/proc/$(pidof vdr)/fd` - e.g. by setting the setuid bit:

sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/wait-for-vdr-snd-release
